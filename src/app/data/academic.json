    "title": "Implementation of the PKJI 2023 Formula in AnyLogic Software for APILL Intersection Performance Modeling",
    "description": "This research project initially explored the development of a smart traffic light system using agent-based modeling in AnyLogic. However, the focus shifted to implementing the formulas from PKJI (Pedoman Kapasitas Jalan Indonesia) 2023 within AnyLogic to model the performance of signalized intersections (Simpang APILL). The project involved translating the PKJI formulas into a functional AnyLogic model to simulate and analyze traffic flow under various conditions.",
    "explanations": [
      "Translated and coded the formulas from PKJI 2023 into an agent-based model in AnyLogic using Java.",
      "Developed an AnyLogic model to simulate the performance of signalized intersections (Simpang APILL) based on PKJI 2023 guidelines.",
      "Conducted simulations to evaluate the impact of different parameter settings on intersection performance metrics, as defined by PKJI 2023.",
      "Gained experience in implementing traffic engineering standards (PKJI) within a simulation environment, using AnyLogic software, and applying Java programming for model development."
